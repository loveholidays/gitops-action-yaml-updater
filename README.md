## Inputs
### `mode`

For docker container image tag we support

For Environment variable values we support
`Deployment StatefulSet` object types

Hint make sure that you have a previous step where you checkout the intended repo ( either the one for this workflow or other )
and calculate and export the short sha using 
`run: echo "::set-output name=GITHUB_SHORT_SHA::$(git rev-parse --short "$GITHUB_SHA") "` and use that output in your step
`new-image-tag: ${{ steps.your-previous-step-id.outputs.GITHUB_SHORT_SHA }}`
